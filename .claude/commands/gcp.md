Git commit and push all staged changes.

1. Run `git status` to see current changes
2. Stage all modified and new files with `git add -A`
3. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
4. Push to remote with `git push`

Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, etc.) and include the Claude Code footer.
