title: Writing with a Political Purpose
---
Why do I write? For growth. The desire for growth made me anxious. I thought to write, and I also wrote to think. Ever since I started working, I wrote out of anxiety. Ten years passed, and as I began to reflect on the 'why' of writing, I was drawn to the book title 'Why I Write?'. After all, George Orwell is quite famous.

It seems that the reason he writes stems from the injustices of the world. Being a product of elite education and a police officer of imperialist Britain, George Orwell's perspective on the world was both a luxury and an agony of an outsider. He explains the reasons for his writing in four ways: sheer egoism, aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse, and political purpose.

> Reviewing my works, whenever I wrote feeble books, fell for flashy passages or meaningless sentences or decorative adjectives or nonsense, it was unfailingly when 'political' purpose was lacking.

Although an elite, George Orwell lived as a vagrant and also worked as a colonial police officer. Observing the absurdities of various societies, he wanted to leave something behind. He wanted to write politically yet 'artistically'. He is someone who prefers to honestly write what he feels rather than maintaining a neutral stance.
