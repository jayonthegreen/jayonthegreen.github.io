Anyone who has experienced 'Planning → Development → Launch' knows that having confidence in an idea is difficult. You're always wondering what people want, failing, and getting frustrated. Conversations often center around "Let's validate quickly!" But they start with the question "How do we do that?" and end with "Let's just work hard and be proactive."

The book suggests that "even prototyping costs money, so let's identify and test people's needs first!" This methodology is called [Pretotyping](https://www.pretotyping.org/). The case of Toss is well-known; they ran ads on a landing page to discover reactions before even creating the product, and people even manually handled transactions behind the scenes. It's the idea of creating a fake version of A to see the reaction to "If A exists, then B will happen."

I have been interested in creating something new. Recently, an opportunity matching this interest emerged at work. I'm starting from scratch with a concept that only has keywords. The thought was, if I make A, then B will succeed. This led to the question: Can we dramatically reduce the cost of creating A? After reading this book, I decided to personally do the groundwork before building a system to test whether B will succeed.
