title: An Exceptional Challenge

I vividly remember the day I first encountered Toss around 2015. Back then, you had to quickly enter the security card numbers to make a bank transfer. The money transfer service offered by Toss at that time was shocking.

In 2016, I began my career at a startup. It was a company with a significant presence in a market with fewer than 30 employees and about a million subscribers. Toss was similar in scale at the time. There were many people I knew, directly or indirectly, and the sizes were comparable. At that time, Toss really felt like a neighboring company. The memories from those years overlapped with the contents of the book. People I had spoken to back then appeared in the book.

To someone like me, who layers fear upon hesitation, this book was a thrilling read. The stories presented are those that are relatively beautiful. Achievements forged amidst suffocating challenges are truly beautiful. It seems like they have built a service and company that will be remembered in history.
