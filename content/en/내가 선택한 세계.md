Burning Man is a community. Every August, a camp is held in the Nevada desert in the United States. The name "Burning Man" comes from a ritual where a human-shaped figure (man) is burned (burn).

In the camp, people are called burners. Burners live in the deprived environment of the desert, detached from civilization. They make extreme efforts to maintain a clean environment there. They wish to interact and create within it. Elon Musk asserted that you cannot truly understand its essence unless you've experienced it yourself.

Reading about these raw stories, I felt like clothes were packaging and hiding me. I felt as if my body was being transported by the subway. Burners refer to the given world as the default world. Conversely, they call the world they choose the real world. A thought crossed my mind that perhaps I am living in the default world. Arenâ€™t modern people being dragged around by too many things in life?

How about going to the desert to find your primal self?
