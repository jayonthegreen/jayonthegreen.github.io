title: Humanism
---

To escape crime and persecution, people immigrate and seek asylum in the United States. They create their own narratives to pass screening processes. The protagonist pleads immigration based on personal injustices experienced. Embellished stories are laced with American elements, such as claiming to support missionary activities and facing injustice as a result.

Sally was a law student who passionately pondered the purpose of law. As a lawyer, she emphasizes formal principles in immigration and asylum representation. In her childhood, Sally witnessed the housemaid stealing food and tattled to her father. Her father asked Sally, "If that person's daughter was hungry, would you share your food?" This was to check for any humanism within his daughter. He was relieved by her warm response to spare her. However, he immediately invokes principles and dismisses the maid.

It makes one contemplate humanism.
