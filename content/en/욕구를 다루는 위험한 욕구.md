I looked up the meaning of addiction. It is described as "to be extremely fond of something and become immersed in it. To develop a dependence due to repeated use of a substance, making it impossible to live a normal life without relying on it physically." I found the book's original title was "se predre," which means "to lose." Aren't addiction and loss slightly different in meaning?

Can one be this honest about sex, infidelity, and love? In some ways, it feels intimately pure. Can one be so anxious and obsessed with someone else? Can everything surrounding oneself be so delicate and interconnected? Isn't honesty about desire something that amplifies the more you look into yourself? Isn't impulse something that grows with impulse?

>"A desire to write about something dangerous that I possess. Like an open basement door that I must enter, no matter the cost."

Could my adulterer have found another woman? And what might happen with his current wife, as he anxiously frets? To some extent, this seems less like impulse and more like love. Why does she desire him so intensely? Is it truly a desire for another person? Or is she projecting and expressing her own instability onto someone else?
