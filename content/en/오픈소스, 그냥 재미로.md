title: Open Source, Just for Fun

Torvalds' human side is amusing. There's a stereotype that geniuses are somehow not relatable, but Linus Torvalds was more ordinary than expected.

> My life philosophy is to earn money and fame while doing something fun and enjoying it. What do you expect from such a person? An instant philanthropist? I don't believe so. - Linus Torvalds

Linus says that people live motivated by three factors: survival, social relationships, and entertainment. Survival and social relationships are straightforward. Entertainment can be a trivial game, or it can be an intellectual pursuit or curiosity to know the world.

For Torvalds, the open-source operating system was entertainment. It wasn't for grandiose or lofty reasons that he chose the open-source method, but to actively receive feedback on his project. Linus disliked when people thought of him as some altruistic monk.

As Linux, which he engaged in just for fun, started to succeed, he handled a significant workload. He mentions that if he'd known in advance the difficulties he'd face, he might have quit early on. However, on the flip side, he also didn't know how much support he would receive or how many people would participate in the development of Linux.
