title: Blood Sugar Spike
---
A blood sugar spike refers to the rapid rise and fall of blood sugar levels. When a blood sugar spike occurs, the molecules in our body enter an inflammatory state. This is essentially aging. Blood sugar spikes make us feel more tired due to hunger, dopamine imbalances, and so on. Our metabolism becomes impaired, and we gain weight. It can be likened to overheating the engine by adding too much coal to a steam locomotive.

To easily prevent blood sugar spikes, eat fiber first. It's best to consume foods in the order of fiber, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Instead of eating carbohydrates alone, it's better to eat them with fats and proteins to slow down rapid sugar absorption. Other good methods include drinking vinegar to inhibit amylase enzymes or taking a 10-20 minute walk after a meal.

From the perspective of diet, vitality, and aging, I started to consider managing blood sugar spikes and implemented some practices, which brought significant changes to my life.
