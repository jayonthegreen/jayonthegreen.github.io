I sold the stocks obtained through exercising stock options, and capital gains tax was incurred. The tax structure is complicated during the exercise and sale of stock options. While gains up to 200 million won per year are tax-exempt at the time of exercise, it needs to be substantiated at the time of sale to avoid overlapping with taxes paid during the exercise.

Last year, I filed my tax return through a tax representative, but this time I wanted to understand it myself, so I directly consulted with the National Tax Service and the tax office. I understood the entire process of how tax benefits and costs offset each other at various points and handled tax reduction on my own. I invested over five hours, and the process was much more stressful than I had anticipated. Depending on how I inputted information into the tax system, the tax amount could vary from several million to tens of millions of won. The system was unfriendly and had many errors.

Nevertheless, I maintained politeness in communicating with the tax officer until the end. We conversed with mutual respect, and the officer showed me a lot of consideration as well. As a result, I was able to reduce my tax by several million won and gained a deep understanding of the tax structure. Although the stress was significant, it was a worthwhile experience.
