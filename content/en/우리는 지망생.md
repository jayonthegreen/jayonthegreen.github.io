title: We Are Aspirants
---

In the film industry, a director's debut is called 입봉. It can take up to 10 years to debut. Aspirants must manage their livelihoods while enduring the process. They hop from study sessions to part-time jobs and film sets, dreaming along the way. We are always aspirants, somewhere in the process of achieving uncertain goals. Those in progress are anxious, alternating between doubting themselves and the world. There's no need to be disappointed if outward passion isn't apparent. But there must be will. At least in this book, aspiring film directors had it. Their stories, as they advance on their long journey, offered a heavy sense of comfort. That journey might be a time of unproductive production.
