title: Reflecting on Past Days at Twilight
---
Stevens, the protagonist who has worked all his life as a butler in a prestigious mansion, embarks on his first journey. He reflects on the past. He unexpectedly meets Miss Kenton, a fellow butler he loved in his younger days. It is only in the twilight of his life that he belatedly realizes the love he had neglected when he was young. As a butler, he was so devoted to the truth that he couldn't be honest about his own feelings of love.
