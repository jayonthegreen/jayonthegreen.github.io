> Isn't it funny? After all the highway journeys, train travels, countless appointments, and many years, life ends up being worth more dead than alive.

There is an aging salesman who was once successful in his youth. He receives a notice of dismissal from the company where he dedicated his entire life. He repeatedly reminisces about his past glory. He cheats on his wife and takes out his anger on his children. He continually feels pathetic. His patriarchal demeanor only makes him more precarious. He worked his whole life to buy a house. Finally, he has a house, but no one lives in it.

Why are we impoverished even after a lifetime of work? What makes us poor?
