title: Calories Are Not the Only Answer
---

Body weight is determined by the body's set point. It is said that wrong eating habits disrupt this system. This is not just about calorie intake and expenditure. You need to eat healthy meals.

The author emphasizes eating habits in dieting. He advises reducing sugar and refined grains while consuming fresh vegetables and proteins. The body's mechanism, involving glucose, insulin, and leptin, needs to be improved through dietary habits.

The key point Dr. Jenkinson makes is, "Don’t count calories, create an environment where your body’s hormones and metabolism can regulate themselves."

1. Restore Leptin Sensitivity: Leptin is a hormone secreted by fat cells that sends a 'full' signal to the brain. However, a diet high in processed foods raises leptin resistance, causing hunger even after eating enough. → A diet centered on **whole foods** (vegetables, proteins, healthy fats) and **minimizing processed food and sugar intake** can restore leptin sensitivity.
2. Stabilize Insulin Levels: Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar, and excessive insulin secretion promotes fat storage and leads to weight gain. → **Reduce refined carbohydrates** (white rice, white flour, etc.) and instead, consume **complex carbohydrates** (brown rice, whole wheat, vegetables, etc.). Also, **reducing snacks between meals and increasing fasting periods** (e.g., intermittent fasting) helps improve insulin sensitivity.
3. Manage Stress: High stress releases a hormone called cortisol, which can increase appetite and lead to abdominal fat storage. → Actively incorporate **meditation, sufficient sleep, and light exercise** into your routine to manage stress.
4. Ensure Sufficient Sleep: Lack of sleep decreases leptin and increases ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite. → Establish a **consistent sleep routine** to secure 7–9 hours of quality sleep per day.

### Conclusion
* It has been confirmed that the amount of fat accumulated in the body is managed by the brain through unconscious processes rather than conscious ones. Dieting is akin to trying to override this unconscious function of the brain, which may be feasible in the short term but ultimately, weight returns to the predetermined set point based on negative feedback. The brain calculates the weight set point based on the surrounding environment, past, and genetics.
* It is already well known that dieting has no long-term effect. What's newly revealed is that dieting can be counterproductive and may even promote weight gain in the long run. The only way to reduce weight is to understand how the body's metabolism and appetite are regulated.
