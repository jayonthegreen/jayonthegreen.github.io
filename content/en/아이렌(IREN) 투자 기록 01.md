Earlier this year, while rebalancing my assets, I increased my portfolio's allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum. I was concerned about Bitcoin's short-term volatility. Therefore, I was looking for suitable related stocks linked to Bitcoin and came across IREN. They had substantial intrinsic value as a data center and already had excellent cash flow from Bitcoin.

( Based on the report of [3Q FY25](https://iren.gcs-web.com/static-files/f76d5271-b6f5-4004-8799-d2659196c427) )

The profitability of the Bitcoin mining business is good.
- The mining cost is less than half of the Bitcoin price.
	- $41k all-in cash cost per Bitcoin mined (vs. $93k revenue per Bitcoin mined)
- As of the end of May 2025, the price and 3Q FY25 performance suggest it is somewhat undervalued, with an EV/EBITDA of about 5.4 times.
	- EV/EBITDA ~= 5.45 EV = $1.8B, EBITDA ~= $330m(E)
	- Record EBITDA of $82.7 million ($62.7 million in Q2 FY25)
- They possess about 40 EH/s of computing power.
	- Considering that the global Bitcoin computation is around 800-1,000 EH/s, they hold a significant market share.

The AI business is somewhat lacking, with an EBITDA of $3.1M (vs $141.2M for Bitcoin).
- Therefore, we need to focus on three main areas: 1) adherence to the roadmap, 2) the ability to flexibly convert Bitcoin infrastructure to AI, and 3) the potential for deal-making as a result.
- 1) Roadmap
	- Horizon 1: Q4 2025
	- Sweetwater 1 (1.4GW): Power supply by April 2026
- 2) Potential for changing Bitcoin infrastructure
	- At the Prince George data center (50MW), they demonstrated the smooth transition of Bitcoin mining equipment (ASIC) to AI GPUs.
	- However, while liquid cooling technology will still be applied, the efficiency and profitability of reusing equipment raises questions and requires further study.
- 3) Revenue generation
	- There is no mention of specific revenue, only a reference to utilization — GPU fleet near full utilization – supporting training and inference workloads, including through white-labeled compute with leading US AI cloud providers (generating an annualized run-rate revenue of $28 million).
