The Courage to Be Disliked. It's a cheesy book title. Such an emotional title actually undermines the value of the book. I ended up reading it after multiple recommendations from various acquaintances.

People have an obsession with explanations. They like causality. Freud says trauma determines much of a person's nature causally. Adler rejected Freud's causation theory. According to Adler, the reason people are unhappy is not because of past circumstances but due to a lack of courage. He suggests that people act according to their goals, not because of past events. Adler believes the reason for not changing is the decision not to change. From the perspective of practicing change and growth, Adler is refreshing. Whether it's Adler or Freud is a secondary issue.

While reading the book, I resolved not to act based on inferiority complex. Phrases like "I did that because I was in a bad mood" are, in fact, creating a "bad mood" state to rationalize actions.
