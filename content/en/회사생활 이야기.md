Memorizing books about the art of dating won't make you an attractive person. The same goes for work. But there are certainly topics worth contemplating. Below are some striking insights I read:

- Don’t try to act smart with enthusiasm before gaining trust. Show goodwill towards the existing system. Simply pointing out flaws won't lead to any changes.
- Companies don’t have long memories. You have the opportunity to improve yourself.
- Workplace friendships are risky.
- Do not make excuses for your mistakes. Focus on how to handle them.
- Attempting to cover up mistakes can lead to irreversible failures.
- Be the first to show commitment to the company.
- Handle your work calmly.
- The world of achievement belongs to optimistic people.
- Don’t try to ‘prove’ yourself. Instead, strive to be helpful.
- Ask, "What are the solutions, which is the best one, and why do you think so?"
- Focus on the situation, not on people.
