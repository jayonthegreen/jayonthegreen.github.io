title: Willpower Can Be Developed
---

Choice is a habit. Therefore, habits significantly impact life and are important. However, habits operate unconsciously. Habits and the unconscious bring changes to life.

When you start to habituate simple tasks, your willpower is cultivated. Try starting with small tasks like eating a salad instead of a hamburger, going to the gym, or doing household chores. Attempt to control your impulses through these small actions. Small habits create a sense of control over life and build confidence. They trigger a chain reaction and bring about change. Representative examples of small but essential habits include exercise, cleaning, and financial management. Willpower and habits can be developed. Habits are better formed in the process of craving something beyond signals and rewards. Suppose there is a reward of feeling clean after brushing your teeth. However, craving the fresh feeling in your mouth itself is more effective in forming a habit.

Recently, in a complicated and tiring life, I focused on exercise, which can be done straightforwardly, and it was quite effective. Let's cultivate habits to enhance life's efficacy and self-control. So that the momentum does not falter.
