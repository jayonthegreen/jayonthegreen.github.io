Murakami was not obsessed with speed and distance when it came to running. Instead, he strived to run every day.

> I've learned a lot about writing novels by running every morning on the road. Naturally, physically, and practically. How much rest is appropriate and where does it become excessive? What is valid consistency, and where does it turn into narrow-mindedness? How much should you be aware of the external scenery, and how deeply should you focus internally? How much should you have confidence in your abilities, and how much should you doubt yourself? If I hadn't started long-distance running deliberately when I became a novelist, I feel that the works I am writing would be quite different from the ones I wrote before.
