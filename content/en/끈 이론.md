This is a book recommended by Bill Gates. He suggested another tennis book besides "The Inner Game of Tennis." The book is by the well-known author David Foster Wallace.

It describes Federer and includes discussions about the commercial US OPEN. Many, including Gates, praise the descriptions and prose. However, it doesn’t resonate with me. I find myself tempted to read it again out of stubbornness.

> “The true opponent, the enfolding boundary, is the player himself. Always and only the self out there, on court, to be met, fought, brought to the limit, and then beyond.”

>I submit that tennis is the most beautiful sport there is and also the most demanding. It requires body control, hand-eye coordination, quickness, flat-out speed, endurance, and that weird mix of caution and abandon we call courage. It also requires smarts. Just one single shot in one exchange in one point of a high-level match is a nightmare of mechanical variables.
