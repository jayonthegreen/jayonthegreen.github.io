There are many things I want to do.
1. Money, relationships, work, health — none of these are unimportant. It's like saying there's no finger that doesn’t hurt.
2. You can accomplish more by living busily. It’s not about having the time to do many things. An idle time of three hours per week is sufficient. While laziness can offer some freedom, it is endless.
3. Selection and focus are necessary. Think about what not to do. _For instance, one of my principles is “Don’t exercise on Saturdays and stay quietly at home.” I tend to do too much during the week, and if I continue on Saturdays, it disrupts my entire weekly rhythm._
4. It’s important to set results and deadlines from the start and try something. There are things I wouldn’t have completed if I hadn’t specified goals and outcomes beforehand.
5. I use AI in the way I consume and produce information, even when writing this type of content.
