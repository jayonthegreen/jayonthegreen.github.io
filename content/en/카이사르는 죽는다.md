I've also spent quite a bit of my youth and I regret it. These days, I diligently play tennis and do weight training. Improving my physical abilities always feels good because it makes me feel younger.

Throughout the book, I watched the death of an ordinary (though somewhat successful) person. I felt the desperation and horror. A person feels downcast when their body is even slightly uncomfortable. Observing the protagonist's death, I found my own body aching. Ivan Ilyich despises the deceit of those around him (even his wife). He is powerless, angry, and despairing.

Death. It allows me to view my life in a simpler and more essential way. The current happiness, pain, agony, joy. It becomes clearer what is trivial and what becomes important. A day will come when I find it difficult to move as well. It's not something that applies only to Caesar.
