title: The Paradigm Shatters
---

Kuhn argues that science advances fundamentally through revolutionary changes, differing from the traditional view that science develops cumulatively and gradually.

Kuhn's structuralist perspective instills a sense of doubt in the life I stand on. It makes me ponder what paradigm I belong to and when its crisis will come. It makes me wonder if I blindly believe in the paradigm. Kuhn's questioning of positivism can be applied beyond the realm of science to life itself.

We learn things. What we learn are paradigms created by eras. Paradigms are not necessarily limited to academic theories. Broadly speaking, anything society believes in can be considered a paradigm. As a high school student, I accepted the academic achievement paradigm. I believed that academic credentials enhanced my value and poured effort into college entrance exams. However, during my university life, I came to think that this paradigm was not everything. Thus, sometimes everything I believe in can collapse.
