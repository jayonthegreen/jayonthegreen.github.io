title: Are You Thou?
---

Positivist philosophy focused on verifying principles through evidence of things. It was popular in the 19th to 20th centuries. Philosophers of that time excluded metaphysical discussions. Husserl opposed this era, advocating to pause judgments and consider human potential, founding "phenomenology." Author Martin Buber follows in the lineage of Husserl's phenomenology. It seems as though Martin Buber shouted, "Are you Thou?" to the positivist philosophers of his time, emphasizing that assault by mechanical facts is not everything. Buber paused judgment momentarily and concentrated on the relationship, being an F focused on connections.

Reading Martin Buber's 'I and Thou,' I realized I too had been neglecting relationships. Reflecting on 2024, I awoke to the importance of relationships through various events, but conversely, there were times I ignored them. In that process, there were moments when I selectively treated those around me not as 'thou' but as 'it.' When judging people or situations, there were times I instrumentalized them and didn't respect them fully. However, no matter how fact-based a judgment might be, an 'I' cannot exist independently. We exist within relationships. Therefore, a loving perspective and respect toward relationships and situations are necessary.
