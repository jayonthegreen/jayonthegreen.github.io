If I were to pick one memorable sentence from the book, it would be **"Start with the conclusion."** So, I'll start with the conclusion. This book doesn't offer anything radically new. It was simply a time to revisit the basics.

To summarize the book: "Start with the conclusion, present your opinions and supporting reasons, and think about what reaction you want to evoke from the reader." The book discusses the O.R.E.O framework: Opinion → Reason → Example → Opinion/Offer. Check if your writing structurally follows this format. It will be surprisingly helpful for writing better pieces.

I want to make persuasive arguments with good ideas and good writing.
