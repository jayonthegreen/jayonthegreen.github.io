title: Bread and Bread Factory
---
What is capitalism?

I definitely read about capitalism somewhere, I thought, as I scanned my bookshelf. That's how I came to revisit this book. I gained a brief understanding of the characteristics of capitalism, early capitalism, late capitalism, and neoliberalism.

We know that the means of production hold more value. If you can buy a bread factory and bread with one billion won, you should buy the bread factory. The routine of daily life rarely permits us the luxury of contemplating 'wealth'. I reflected on whether my economic activities truly enrich me. Am I purchasing bread instead of a bread factory?

I reconsidered whether I am focusing my time more valuably. It's not about becoming a capitalist, but rather about reflecting on how much I am investing in 'myself' as a means of production in a broader sense. Unsettled and curious about my lack of knowledge in economics, I bought three books. It was delightful to be intellectually stimulated after such a long time.
