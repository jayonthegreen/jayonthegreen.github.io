I am distinguished from everything I gaze upon. I am not the other, and I exist only as myself. Thus, the essence of existence initially lies in "solitude."

However, Levinas did not view this solitude merely as loneliness. He believed that existence opens up as we establish relationships with others, and within those relationships, responsibility and meaning arise. His notion of time was like an encounter with others, akin to death, that cannot be grasped. Levinas appears to be a somewhat more relationship-oriented thinker than Heidegger.

Feeling powerless from the distinction and solitude of being "I," and advancing towards death, yet facing the ungraspable other—this is Levinas' concept of time and the other. His method of exposition involves defining a concept and setting boundaries, only to transcend them again. It's as if he frequently articulates "nevertheless~," continuing the logic.
