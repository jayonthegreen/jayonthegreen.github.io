title: The Hardest Thing to Act
---

I bought and read an essay for the first time. It was written in a straightforward manner, making it easy to read.

The piece titled 'The Hardest Thing to Act' was the most interesting. It states that the hardest thing to act is "oneself." Humans have a desire to become someone else, to pretend to be someone else. This is referred to as the theatrical self. We all have likely played roles without being taught how when we were younger. Depending on the situation, we bring out different selves to act. It is truly difficult to act out the 'self' that plays various roles.

I also have multiple selves. Let's not obsess over finding an unchanging self. Let's understand the self that plays various roles. Acting the required role helps in performing that role well. As long as we guard against decorating without essence, acting isn't bad. Perhaps distinguishing between mimicking and immersing oneself in a role is not easy.
