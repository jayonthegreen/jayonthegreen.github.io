title: Feel and Focus
---

Do not judge yourself with affirmations or negations and push yourself harshly. Doesn't a child continuously learn amidst imperfection? You shouldn't make your focusing self anxious by nagging. Excessive nagging is not effective.

When playing tennis, many thoughts arise, which can actually lead to mistakes. Looking back at times when I played well, there was a state of flow without thought. In future matches, when things aren't going well, I should try to feel calmly and focus, rather than think too much.

This isn't just a story about tennis.
