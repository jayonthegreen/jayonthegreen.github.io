Peeking into the lives of others is intriguing. Isul Ah is an interesting person. Her perspective on the world and herself, along with the characters she portrays, are captivating. Furthermore, the way she expresses it is entertaining.

She shares poignant experiences about embarking on a journey into the distant cosmos, knowing that in VR, she can try again. Expressions like "Woo-seong, we just slept together once, weâ€™re not in a relationship," and "acts like someone who decided not to accept wedding gifts" are candid and cheerful.

I also felt that it would be great to wittily document moments when I, the world, and others lingered together, rather than solely delving into my own interior.
