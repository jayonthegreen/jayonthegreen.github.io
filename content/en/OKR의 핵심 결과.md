I first encountered OKR in 2018. There were OKRs for the company, the team, and individuals. I wrote my personal OKRs by referring to the OKRs of higher-ups and colleagues. Writing them was difficult, but it felt like a form of self-improvement. I understood it as a guideline for personal actions, separate from the work I was doing at the company.

A few years later, I engaged with OKR again. This time, it was task and project-oriented, centered around metrics. It was closely related to the tasks I was currently working on. Managers recorded and tracked the targets and key results of the tasks. I got the sense that many people were concerned about those numbers. However, the entire team didn't seriously analyze these numbers or think through and execute them together.

Again, a few years later, I participated in OKRs in an organization with over a hundred people. As dozens or even hundreds of people were involved, understanding each other's tasks and collaborating became more challenging. Adding "objectives" and "key results" to tasks greatly helped in understanding them.

I joined a new organization. It had just exceeded 100 people, reaching a stage where some processes and systems were necessary. I was in a position to manage the company's goals and tasks. My role was to gather fragmented tasks and attach objectives and results to them. This led me to ponder how to transform this organization, and I decided to read a book on the subject. OKR is not a complex tool. The core result of OKR is to achieve performance.

The following points from the book were particularly impressive:
- Employees must participate in the goal-setting process. Employees should be part of a community built on trust and respect, not just money-making machines.
- Compared to traditional MRO/KPIs, OKRs should be formal, transparent, and include the "what" and "how." They should be aggressive, challenging, and incorporate both top-down and horizontal approaches. The best teams exist in the creative tension between top-down and bottom-up goal setting.
- Less is more. Limiting the number of OKRs to 3-5 per cycle helps you focus on important values. Steve Jobs famously said, "Innovation is saying no to a thousand things." Too many goals can dilute focus and lead to distractions by unimportant matters.
- Persistence and determination. It takes 4-5 quarters to fully adopt an OKR system. Moreover, it takes even longer to develop the competencies necessary for goal achievement.
- "When you're tired of saying it, that's when your employees start listening."
- "I adopted the key goals from my boss's OKR as my objectives."
- Make sure that resources needed can be found on the OKR sheet, allowing related information to be swiftly accessed.
