In the routine of realistic conversations, it feels like meeting a simple and genuine adult.

## Summary
- To properly implement the targeted worldview, there should only be one captain.
- To develop a sense, sincerely like something.
- As your sense of what you like grows, become someone who can also respect the sense of others.
- Sense isn't a brilliant idea. It is something nurtured through constant reflection, study, and training.
- The method to think of a sensible plan is as follows. Start from the most commonsensical and fundamental thoughts.
- A person with sense is someone who reminds us of the essence we've forgotten.
- I once heard someone talk about a sense of ownership, "The state where you can say that work is more important than yourself when you can let go of yourself."
- People gather around someone with conviction.
- It's not remarkable to think of putting a little water in a toaster to revive stale bread. What's remarkable is the 'sincerity' to keep thinking and developing ideas to the point you come up with such an idea.
- I recommend for your first company, a small organization where you can closely interact with a respectable owner. (...) Instead of gaining the impression of 'a warm space where good people work together,' you might perceive it as a 'place of power games where queuing up is important.'
