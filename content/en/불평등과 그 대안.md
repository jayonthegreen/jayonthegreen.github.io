title: Inequality and Its Alternatives
---

Radical Markets presents the issue of escalating inequality and offers solutions. The idea is that the person who bids the highest price for an item or land gets it and pays taxes proportionately. In short, only those who can afford it should take on the responsibility. This would lead to efficient utilization of the world's resources. The concept of [quadratic voting](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A0%9C%EA%B3%B1_%ED%88%AC%ED%91%9C) was particularly interesting.

These were somewhat extreme ideas—thoughts I wouldn’t ordinarily have considered.

Summary   
- The most crucial issue of our time is the deepening inequality occurring in developed countries. (…)
* Some economists argue that inequality worsens as economic rewards diverge based on skills. However, escalating inequality arises not from wage disparities but from the decreasing share of labor income in national income. (…)
* "A family traveling in a comfortable, air-conditioned car must pass through cities covered in trash and lined with ugly buildings and utility poles that should have been demolished long ago, amid poorly paved roads."
* To impose taxes based on the value of property, it is important to establish a process for accurately assessing its economic value. There is a very simple economic method: each person evaluates their property and announces the assessed value, allowing anyone to purchase it at that price. This system is straightforward, can be executed without third-party intervention, has no room for corruption, and incurs minimal administrative costs. Moreover, it motivates each property to be used in the most economically productive way, in addition to existing market incentives.
* Politics is not the only area where market functions do not operate properly. Various immigration restrictions prevent the efficient allocation of labor by hindering cross-border labor movement. In the digital economy, data—being the most crucial asset—is collected and monetized by companies like Google and Facebook, while the users producing that data receive no compensation. A market for this is urgently needed but does not exist. The economy we typically assume to be fully competitive essentially suffers from either monopolized markets or a complete absence of markets.
* The alternative proposal that every citizen should have an equal voice and everything should be decided by majority rule has serious flaws. What happens to minorities under the majority rule? They may consider certain issues more important than others. For example, issues like bathroom rights for transgender individuals or abortion prohibition. However, there is no mechanism to express opinions proportional to the perceived significance of an issue. The one-person-one-vote system fails to account for diverse opinions across multiple groups and is influenced by the size of ideological blocks.
* According to Adam Smith’s insight, “We get our dinner not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, but from their regard for their self-interest.” While now a rather clichéd expression, the idea that pursuing solely self-interest could achieve public good was a radical insight that was not easily conceivable.
