title: Evening
---
A baby boy is born and named after his grandfather. His name is Johannes. Johannes gets married and has seven children. As time passes, he feels the solitude of old age. His wife Erna, with whom he shared his daily life, and his friend Peter, with whom he exchanged haircuts, have both passed away. He is left alone in his room to face the silence. No matter what he does, the house does not become warm or bright. His body feels stiff and uncomfortable. Even fishing at sea doesn't go well. Objects seem too burdensome yet weightless. Johannes is left with his thin fingers and bluish nails. The coffee he drinks every morning, the cigarettes, and the bread with brown cheese remain the same. He calmly witnesses the beginning and end of his life.

I have a newborn nephew and parents who are concerned about health. I attend weddings and funerals from time to time. As I get older, I think about life and what my old age might be like. Now that I'm in my 30s, I spend more time thinking about love, family, and friends than I did in my 20s. Many of the people I play tennis with are in their 40s. They are young and cheerful. Naturally, I often think it would be nice to continue enjoying tennis with health and fun as I age. At our tennis gatherings, when we sometimes drink, there's a saying: "People who play tennis see each other for life." I too find this group extremely precious and enjoyable. It's like Johannes and Peter's friendship, where they cut each other's hair. However, this won't be eternal either. 

Life, after all, moves towards death and farewells.
