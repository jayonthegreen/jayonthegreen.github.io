There was a time when advertisements encouraged the use of electricity not just for light bulbs but in other areas as well. This was a story from a time when electricity was not yet widespread. In 2003, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, talks about the web. It was a period after the dot-com bubble, and there would have been a lot of skepticism in the market. By referring to the early days of the web, he expresses optimism that, although primitive now, it has the potential to develop. This reflects a positive attitude towards the upcoming internet world.
