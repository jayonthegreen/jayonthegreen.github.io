title: Introduction to Finance Book
---
This book covers a variety of topics such as shareholder capitalism, government bonds, economic openness, foreign capital, real estate issues, and the financialization of infrastructure. Throughout the book, a persistent question kept coming to mind: "Why must a country issue government bonds? Can't money just be printed?"

While the book doesn't directly answer this, it implies through various examples that government bonds are not simply ‘national debt’ but **a contractual act based on a trust relationship with the market**. Randomly printing money leads to inflation. Government bonds are a way to avoid these side effects while raising necessary finances. By ‘borrowing’ funds from the market, a country maintains transparency in asset management and establishes credit-based relationships with financial market participants.

This structure becomes more apparent when looking at the financial strategy of the United States. The U.S. raises astronomical finances through government bonds, voluntarily purchased by countries worldwide, and maintains economic, military, and technological hegemony based on this. The dollar acts as the world's reserve currency, allowing the U.S. to dominate the global economy while borrowing in its currency. In contrast, China is challenging the U.S. dollar hegemony by promoting the internationalization of the renminbi. It is expanding its finance-centered infrastructure and strengthening monetary sovereignty through new currency experiments like digital yuan. Both countries **utilize finance as a core pillar of state power, not merely as a tool**.

As in the example of Subway Line 9 in the book, when public resources are privatized or financialized, a nation constantly faces the choice between directly financing or relying on external financial markets. Government bonds are central to such decisions. Thus, even states operate as financial entities dictated by the logic of capital markets. This book gradually reveals the structure of such a world.

The same goes for companies, which can be viewed as financial products. Suppose a company earning 1 billion won a year is being sold for 10 billion won. Yet, if the bank interest rate is 50% per annum, netting 5 billion won a year from a bank deposit, most would choose the deposit. The book easily explains that "a year's corporate profit" and "interest income from a deposit" should roughly align with worldly reasoning. The world constantly measures 'expected return' and 'risk.'

The content of the book made me look at life around me with a new perspective, then made it familiar again. It was surprising to learn that Subway Line 9 was once operated by a private company, and that such financialization of societal infrastructure is already common in the U.S. A familiar city rail suddenly seemed unfamiliar.

With the global economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus, the U.S. Federal Reserve (FRB) declared unlimited quantitative easing. Supplying liquidity is difficult to achieve without backing from government bonds based on market trust. A colleague said that by holding stocks and bonds equally, they could protect their assets even in a plunging stock market. Finance has become a survival skill for individuals, nations, and global systems alike.
