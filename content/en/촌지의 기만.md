title: Deception of Bribes
---

With the flourishing of the husband’s business, the couple escapes poverty. They no longer feel guilty for not buying things at the department store. It’s because they’re not casting covetous eyes on unreasonably expensive items. When they were poor, even their children sometimes seemed like enemies. They now intend to send their youngest son to a private school to raise him without envy. Memories of times when they couldn’t afford to give bribes and thus couldn’t attend school resurface. But now, those days are different. Her husband, who earns well, seems more lovable than ever.

She heads to her son's school to hand over a bribe. Mothers in mink coats form a fortress around the teacher. The fortification is so solid that she can’t even say hello. She paces the playground, touching the envelope of money. It feels pitiful. She stops by a bookstore to select a gift for her son. Biographies are there. They’re stories of people who overcame adversity to succeed. The tales from times when the impenetrable and ugly walls of falsehood stood between teachers and students are absent from these biographies.

She cannot deceive her son. She tries to clear her throat loudly to spit out phlegm, but her throat only feels scratchy.
