title: Walking 10,000 Steps
---
For ambiguous distances, I ride on wheels. Gradually, my two legs are losing the chance to walk. After I started working, my weight increased. Now, my legs hurt even if I walk just a little. I read Ha Jung-woo's book. He says that during such times, you need to walk even more.

I like Ha Jung-woo. His charming demeanor when enjoying soju with a Melona is attractive. His calm, measured tone is cool. He's slightly cheeky but approachable, which is nice. Some celebrities feel like they live in another world, but not Ha Jung-woo.

Ha Jung-woo's stories about walking have changed me. I've started walking 10,000 steps a day, too. It really is quite a workout. I've heard that by just avoiding hamburgers and a few other foods while steadily walking 10,000 steps a day, you can lose weight. I believe it.

This book has invigorated me.
