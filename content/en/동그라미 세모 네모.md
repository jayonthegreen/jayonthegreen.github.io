> "There is a significant gap between knowing and understanding."

It is important to clearly distinguish between not knowing, knowing, and understanding. To understand, experience must come first. Even the same knowledge can transform from mere knowing to understanding through experience.

To understand a circle, you must also know triangles and squares. Instead of being engrossed in just one thing, understanding various things might lead to a more accurate understanding. If you only live eating Korean cuisine, it is hard to discern its distinct characteristics. Since everything will meet someday, why not travel the field?
