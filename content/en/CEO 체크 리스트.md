The book allows for a comprehensive and structural review of a company, enabling a broad perspective.

Finding a co-founder who can complement my abilities is crucial. First, I need to clearly understand who I am. Meanwhile, prioritizing personal gain over the overall profit of the company often causes problems.

I reconsidered my work habits. Keeping the inbox at 'zero' every day to quickly filter important agendas, listing tasks (GTD), or designating time to focus on important tasks is quite useful. Being humble, grateful, keeping promises, loving your work, and maintaining a diligent attitude towards exercise are also important.

Careful preparation is needed for effective discussions. It's essential to check the structure of discussions and opinion gathering (whether to limit choices, provide options, or share issues) and to arrive at clear agreements (who will do what by when). Structuring thoughts and breaking down discussions make problem-solving much more streamlined.

When building a corporate culture, it's effective to connect abstract phrases to behavioral norms. As the saying goes, "Culture is the name for those rules," culture must imply rules to have strong executory power.

Lastly, I reflected on the importance of relationships in transactions (investment, sales, recruitment, etc.). In my view, forming trust that the counterpart is a rational and honest person through relationships can play a decisive role in concluding deals. Often, I encounter people who exaggerate excessively and make irrational claims. This leads to dishonest behavior and eventually losing trust. Therefore, it's unnecessary to be overly cynical about relationships, and it can be useful to refer to those who manage relationships well.
