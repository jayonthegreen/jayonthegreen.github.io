Taking notes is a powerful tool for thinking.

I like taking notes on a yellow legal pad. I wanted to transfer that experience to the iPad. So, I bought an Apple Pencil. It was inconvenient.

Paper lets thoughts flow freely, but the iPad did not. Surprisingly, digital notes didn’t quite capture much. I thought it would be better to take notes and then type them up once a week, keeping only what's necessary.

I tried to improve my digital note-taking with the Apple Pencil but gave up. So, I sold the Apple Pencil secondhand. Then I went to Muji to buy pens and a notebook.

Sam Altman’s approach to writing is intriguing. I tried to keep all notes, but he didn’t. There's no need to save all analog notebooks digitally. It might be enough to clarify thoughts and record only what's worth it.

Returning to pen and paper for a few days feels great. It feels like more thoughts are flowing.

## Summary of "Sam Altman – OpenAI Founder Reveals His Writing System"

The impact of AI on writing and communication

- Sam Altman believes LLMs will change the way people write in the future [[00:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=27)].

- He highlights the inefficiency of people putting points into LLMs, generating emails, and then others summarizing them again [[00:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=36)].

- Altman expects LLMs to not only expand points but also to be excellent tools for discovering new things within the realm of ideas [[01:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=67)].

- He mentions that the concept of "tools for thought" has existed for decades, but most people still use word processors without computer assistance [[01:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=80)].

The importance of language

- Altman emphasizes that language will still play a crucial role in communicating and programming with computers [[02:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=128)].

- He says the revolutionary aspect of ChatGPT is allowing people to converse with computers in plain English to accomplish various tasks [[02:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=143)].

- Text holds special value because it's searchable and easy to manipulate [[02:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=164)], and he adds that there's rigor in thinking in text [[03:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=183)].

- It provides clarity by letting you contest specific words or sentences rather than merely discussing the overall vibe [[03:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=190)].

ChatGPT's impact on teaching writing

- Altman expects writing courses in the future may not change drastically, although he’s unsure how they’ll evolve [[03:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=214)].

- He believes new tools will help people write differently, better refining and generating ideas [[03:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=223)].

- If ChatGPT helps people think at a higher quality through writing activities, that would be excellent [[04:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=252)].

- One significant value of writing is clarifying your thoughts, and if new tools can help with this, it would be a great victory [[04:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=267)].

Utilizing ChatGPT

- Altman finds ChatGPT useful for planting the "initial seed" of ideas [[04:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=279)].

- If ChatGPT disagrees with his ideas, he knows the idea is unique [[04:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=290)].

- Clarifying an idea helps ChatGPT find examples and stories to amplify it [[04:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=296)].

- Altman also mentions using ChatGPT for programming support [[07:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=453)] and summarizing long emails [[08:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=502)].

Clear thinking and writing

- Altman emphasizes the need to spend more effort thinking about what work to do [[11:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=696)].

- He considers writing as "externalized thinking" [[12:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=746)] and says he hasn’t found a better way to tackle difficult problems than writing [[12:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=753)].

- Writing is a powerful thinking tool that aids in clarifying thoughts and explaining them to others [[12:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=765)].

- Altman believes clear communication stems from clear thinking [[13:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=789)].

**Note-Taking System**

- Altman prefers spiral notebooks because you can easily tear out pages, view multiple pages at once, and crumple and discard them [[43:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2583)].

- He cites the Uniball Micro 5 pen as the best, while also liking Muji 36 or 37 dark blue ink pens [[44:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2645)].

**The Future of AI and Writing**

- Altman believes writing’s primary importance as a tool for thought will remain unchanged [[45:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2710)].

- He has seen no evidence supporting the claim that AI is killing writing [[45:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2751)] and suggests that "full superintelligence" would be needed for AI to completely replace human writing [[46:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2774)].

- He believes that, just as people want to know the life stories of authors when reading great books, this human connection will be absent in AI-written texts [[46:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2802)].
