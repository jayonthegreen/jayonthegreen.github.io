Taking notes is a powerful tool for thinking.

I love using yellow legal pads for note-taking. I wanted to transfer that experience to the iPad. So, I bought an Apple Pencil. It was inconvenient.

Paper allows thoughts to flow freely, but the iPad didn't. Surprisingly, digital records didn't capture things in a significant way. I thought it was better to jot down notes and type them up weekly, keeping only what was necessary.

I tried to improve digital note-taking with the Apple Pencil but gave up. So, I sold the Apple Pencil second-hand. Then, I went to Muji and bought a pen and notebook.

Content about Sam Altman's writing method is fascinating. I wanted to keep every note, but he didn't. Not every analog notebook needs to be stored digitally. It seems fine to just clarify thoughts and keep only what is worth recording.

I've been back to using paper and pen for a few days, and it's great. It feels like I'm doing more thinking.

## Summary of "Sam Altman â€“ OpenAI Founder Reveals His Writing System"

The Impact of AI on Writing and Communication

- Sam Altman believes that LLMs will change how people write in the future [[00:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=27)].
    
- He points out the inefficiency where people input points into LLMs to generate emails only for others to summarize them again [[00:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=36)].
    
- Altman expects that LLMs will be great tools not only for expanding points but also for discovering new ideas in the realm of ideas [[01:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=67)].
    
- He mentions that despite having the concept of "tools for thought" for decades, most people still use word processors without computer assistance [[01:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=80)].
    

The Importance of Language

- Altman emphasizes that language will still play an important role in communicating and programming with computers [[02:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=128)].
    
- He mentions that the revolutionary aspect of ChatGPT is that it allows people to converse with computers in plain English and perform various tasks [[02:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=143)].
    
- Text holds special value because it can be searched and manipulated easily [[02:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=164)], and he adds that there is rigor in thinking with text [[03:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=183)].
    
- This is because one can challenge specific words or sentences, providing clarity rather than just discussing general moods [[03:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=190)].
    

The Impact of ChatGPT on Writing Education

- Altman is not sure how writing courses will look in the future but predicts they won't change significantly [[03:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=214)].
    
- He believes that new tools will help people write differently and better refine and generate ideas [[03:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=223)].
    
- He says that if ChatGPT helps people engage in higher-quality thinking through writing activities, that would be great [[04:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=252)].
    
- One of the great values of writing is clarifying one's thoughts, and if new tools can help do this better, it would be a significant win [[04:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=267)].
    

Using ChatGPT

- Altman finds ChatGPT useful in planting the "initial seeds" of ideas [[04:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=279)].
    
- If ChatGPT disagrees with his thoughts, he knows the idea is unique [[04:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=290)].
    
- Clarifying ideas helps ChatGPT find examples and stories that amplify them [[04:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=296)].
    
- Altman also uses ChatGPT for programming support [[07:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=453)] and summarizing long emails [[08:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=502)].
    

Clear Thinking and Writing

- Altman emphasizes the need to put more effort into thinking about what work to do [[11:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=696)].
    
- He thinks of writing as "externalized thinking" [[12:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=746)], and has not found a better way than writing when facing difficult problems [[12:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=753)].
    
- Writing is a powerful thinking tool that helps clarify thoughts and explain them to others [[12:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=765)].
    
- Altman believes that clear communication comes from clear thinking [[13:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=789)].
    

**Note-Taking System**

- Altman prefers spiral notebooks, as pages can be easily torn out, multiple pages can be viewed at once, and they can be crumpled and discarded [[43:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2583)].
    
- He regards the Uni-ball Micro 5 pen as the best pen, and also likes Muji 36 or 37 dark blue ink pens [[44:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2645)].
    

**The Future of AI and Writing**

- Altman thinks writing remains primarily a tool for thinking, which will not change [[45:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2710)].
    
- He sees no evidence to support the claim that AI is killing writing [[45:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2751)], and suggests that "a complete superintelligence" would be needed to entirely replace human writing [[46:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2774)].
    
- He believes that, like when reading a great book, people want to know the story of the author's life, and that kind of human connection is not felt with AI-written content [[46:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0&t=2802)].
