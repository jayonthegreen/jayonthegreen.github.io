> "No one can think without writing. - Niklas Luhmann"

I am also quite a note-taker. My notes were more akin to light impressions than sharp opinions and thoughts. After discovering Obsidian, I naturally became interested in the note-taking method known as [[Zettelkasten]].

In Zettelkasten, the important thing is the connection between notes. The purpose of connection is not merely storage. It is for the organic understanding and development of thoughts. When you relate one unit of meaning to another, additional context emerges. For example, there is a clear difference between just memorizing the characteristics of arteries and veins, and understanding how they exit and enter the heart.

After reading the book, my perspective on notes changed significantly. I used to take notes to store memories. Strictly speaking, I took notes with the purpose of storing memories, but it turned out to be quite useless. I didn't refer back to them. I wanted to break free from the mindset of just writing things down without purpose.
