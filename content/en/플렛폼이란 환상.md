title: The Illusion of Platforms
---

Platform. Just hearing the word makes me slightly cringy. It's disappointing when people who claim to change the world by building a platform end their statement with "if only we had a developer...". Although there are countless reasons why something may not succeed, I always respect and admire the energy to accomplish something within those constraints. However, there is also a part of me that remains skeptical.

When discussing the platform business, companies dream of creating value by utilizing resources they don't directly own. On the other hand, traditional consumer goods-based businesses provide services based on a one-way pipeline of 'planning → development → mass production → sales'. For example, while publishers select and contract authors, anyone can publish a book on the Amazon Kindle platform. As gatekeepers disappear, consumers can select products that better suit them. Once a certain number of participants gather on a platform, a virtuous circle can lead to explosive growth. Many people dream of a platform revolution.

How do you create a platform that survives like an explosive, living organism? After thinking about this and that, I eventually feel that while strategy is important, execution is the real strategy. However, an early startup cannot follow Facebook's platform strategy from 2019. As a developer making products, I sometimes feel that people who talk about platform strategies are chasing illusions.

Mike Tyson's saying, "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth," seems to fit strategies perfectly. Execution is crucial in building a platform. Just as life is about real experience, platforms are about practice, not strategy. This isn't to disparage strategy, of course.
