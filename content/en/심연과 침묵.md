title: Depth and Silence
---

Trying to clean the lime powder off the wall, it remains as white dust. An indelible gray mark is left behind.

Hans returns a coat he had stolen and meets Regina, falling in love with her. Regina continues her life through theft and blood donations. She feels as if this suffering will last forever. She almost envies her child who died during the war.

Dr. Fischer, a Nazi party member, uses religion indiscriminately, indulging himself while feeling ennui. The face of the marble angel statue bears a soft and painful smile. People who are thoroughly destroyed within. Even in ruins, they scour the city for bread. Perhaps while deeply rotten inside and disillusioned by the affluent cathedral, the hope that eating might end their persistent torment keeps Hans lingering at the cathedral.

The angel statue seems to reflect our appearance, forced into silence by such depths. Instead of anger, there is apathy and pain; instead of hope, excitement for survival; instead of love, an overwhelming fatigue prevails.
