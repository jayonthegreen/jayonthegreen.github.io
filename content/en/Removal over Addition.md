I went into my podcast app and unfollowed all but one account. I wanted to remove rather than add.

Some decisions from years ago that I couldn't subtract come to mind. I reflect on choices I mistakenly thought could be postponed, which in reality led to irreversible outcomes. Most decisions to remove something passed by with hesitation.

I constantly worry about what to do. The truly important thing is to ponder and practice what not to do. Someone once said, "Write down three things you want to do, and erase two of them." It's better to avoid eating snacks than to worry about which supplements to take. Rather than defining goals and tasks, reducing wasted time is what's needed.

The more you subtract, the simpler your standards become and the more at ease you feel. High expectations and obsessions only erode your peace of mind.

The density of life emerges in the empty spaces.
