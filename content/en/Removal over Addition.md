I went into my podcast app and unfollowed all accounts except one. I wanted to remove, not add more.

I recall decisions from years ago that I couldn't let go of. I now realize that choices I thought I could delay were actually decisions that led to irreversible outcomes. Most of these choices to remove something floated by hesitantly.

I am always pondering what to do. The truly important thing is to contemplate and act on what not to do. Someone suggested, "Write down three things you want to do and erase two of them." It's better to avoid snacks rather than worry about which supplements to take. Reducing time wastage is more effective than defining goals and tasks.

The more you remove, the simpler the criteria become, and the more at ease you feel. High expectations and obsessions only erode the mind.

The density of life is created in the empty spaces.
