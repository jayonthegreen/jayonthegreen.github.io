title: There's No Perfect Moment in Business
---

I want to do my own thing. I constantly ponder what, when, how, and why I should do something. I gauge that possibility through side projects. Simple and straightforward phrases like "To turn a dream into reality, you just have to do it" and "I just wanted to have my own company and do something on the internet" stick in my mind.

The detailed stories from the early days of Netflix were quite interesting. Even the founders had small anecdotes, like making sure to spend at least one evening a week at home with their spouses, to continuously improving from the start using A/B testing and metrics monitoring. Designing the feature that automatically delivers the next DVDs as soon as you return the previous ones was impressive. The bold decision not to sell DVDs and focus elsewhere showed admirable courage.

It's said that countless ideas were jotted down. One of them was Netflix. It will always be filled with unforeseen events. You will wander somewhere between meticulously organized plans and unexpected incidents. Netflix likely did too, and this book capturing that journey was an entertaining read.
