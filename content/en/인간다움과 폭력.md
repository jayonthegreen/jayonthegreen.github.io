title: Humanity and Violence
---
We pursue humanity. We strive to distinguish between humans and non-human animals, even forgetting the fact that humans are just one species of animal. Within humanity, each individual has their own sense of humaneness. For some, pursuing rationality is a way to find the meaning of humanity, while for others, critiquing violence is the path. As long as we avoid imposing violence on the lives of others, there is nothing we cannot do.

The common notion of not being violent towards others is, in reality, just a direction. The world crumbles easily. Life is complex and violent.
