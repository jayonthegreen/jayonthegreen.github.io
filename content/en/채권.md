**What are Bonds?:** Bonds are certificates in which the issuer promises to repay the principal and interest over a certain period. Bonds are called fixed income in English because the amount of money to be received in the future is predetermined.

**Factors Determining Bond Prices:** The interest on bonds is proportional to the risk that the debtor may not be able to repay the money. The higher the risk of not getting your money back, the higher the interest it is natural to receive from the lender's standpoint. From a risk perspective, the duration of the bond also affects the interest and bond. The longer the repayment period for the amount to be repaid, the more exposed it is to risks (inflation, interest rate changes, default probability), thus requiring more interest.

[Bonds and Interest Rates]: The price of a bond can differ from the money to be repaid from the bond. Imagine hypothetically getting the principal at a specific point in the future with 0% interest. Doesn't it sound odd? Even a bank deposit grows with added interest, so you would feel at a loss as the value of money relative decreases. That’s why interest is received. Once the principal and interest are set, it can be a loss or not depending on the interest rates. The attractiveness of bonds changes with ever-changing interest rates, and this is reflected in the bond prices. The supply and demand of bonds also determine bond prices. Thus, the market determines the price of bonds as a product.

[Government Bonds]: From this perspective, bonds issued by the country (government bonds) are the safest. Typically, the yield on government bonds is lower than all financial returns. Therefore, government bond yields can be seen as an indicator for financial products overall. The government might urgently need money, and issuing currency in such cases carries inflation risks, so they operate by issuing bonds.

[The Meaning of Bond Position in a Portfolio]: Why should bonds be included in a portfolio? Wouldn't it be better to have all assets in stocks? I cite two reasons for including bonds. First, bonds serve as "spare money" in the process of long-term investment. Here "spare" refers to the cash proportion in your assets. If someone with 100 million cash invests 1 million in stocks, even if the 1 million extreme becomes 0, that person relatively retains "spare" capacity. However, this assumes bonds are arranged similarly to short-term government bonds and deposits. Second, when stocks result in losses, bond yields compensate for that value. Remember that the stocks you choose are not always the right answer. Simplifying it extremely, it can be expressed as reducing risk. If volatility is high and risk is high, people cannot endure. Do you want to grow together with the stock market? You need to survive in the stock market. Hence, to avoid losing and not leaving, reducing risk is realistic. Note that here we are talking about short-term government bonds and high-quality bonds. We are not talking about long-term bonds closer to stocks. Think of them as deposits that give a little more interest.

[How Much Bonds to Hold]: How much should bonds be included in the portfolio? Warren Buffett does not favor bonds. However, it’s known that he advises allocating about 10% of the money left to his wife in U.S. short-term government bonds and investing the remaining 90% in the S&P 500 index. John C. Bogle, the first CEO of Vanguard Group and father of the index fund, said one should hold bonds in percentage equal to one's age. For instance, if you are 30 years old, hold 30%. The All Weather Portfolio suggests 40% long-term government bonds, 15% medium-term government bonds, and the Talmudic method suggests about a third in cash (bonds, safe assets). Benjamin Graham's 'Intelligent Investor' advises holding 25% to 75%.

[Bond-Related Indicators]: One should consider benchmark interest rates, inflation (consumer price index, producer price index), and government bond yields (U.S. 10-year bond yield, bond spread). Additionally, one could look at credit spreads, federal reserve statements, GDP growth rates, and several other indicators. But this is not about bond trading. Thus, examining the benchmark interest rate, consumer price index, and U.S. 10-year bond yield is recommended.

[What Should I Do?]: Aim to hold 10% of short-term government bonds (Vanguard U.S. Short-Term Bond ETF, BSV) within the entire assets of the year. A significant portion of my current assets is invested in individual stocks, which can be categorized as “growth stocks," requiring assessment. Considering whether to pay off low-interest corporate loans, aiming for about 10% bond proportion seems realistic.
