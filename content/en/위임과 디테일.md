title: Delegation and Detail
---

Not knowing delegation and detail are completely different. It's important to directly solve problems for delegated matters if necessary.

I've experienced various leaders in different situations. Among them, many could not engage in fundamental discussions because they did not know the details. Rather than admitting their lack of detail, they used "delegation" as an excuse.

Looking at the examples of great leaders like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, there are many stories of them taking care of the details and solving problems. The advice "hire good people and delegate" may often be distorted and applied excessively. The current CEO of our multi-billion-dollar company reviews app design drafts personally and even checks the seam condition of products. This is clearly different from the typical managerial mode of delegation.

Sometimes I meet solid people who give off good energy, regardless of their position, who know the details of most of the things they’ve delegated, especially when it comes to important matters.
