title: The Framework of an Interview
---

I frequently read Kim Hyungsuk's writings. They often help me organize my own experiences. His work is structurally well-organized and profound. For example, in his writing about [Delegation and Involvement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/divercity_%EC%9C%84%EC%9E%84%EC%9D%84-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B4-%EC%A2%8B%EC%9D%80%EC%A7%80-%EA%B4%80%EC%97%AC%EB%A5%BC-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B4-%EC%A2%8B%EC%9D%80%EC%A7%80-%EA%B3%A0%EB%AF%BC%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%A6%AC%EB%8D%94%EA%B0%80-%EB%A7%8E%EB%8B%A4-activity-7270618174646042624-E-FW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), he emphasizes the essence of "who you want to work with," beyond the right or wrong. Lately, I've been pondering "What makes a good question?" and I found myself reaching for a book due to frequent recent interviews.

An interview is ultimately a process to understand oneself, the company, and the job. Even outside of interviews, posing questions and devising one's own answers is meaningful. For example, how can my strengths be tied to weaknesses? What am I missing, and what am I striving to achieve in life? When do I feel most excited at work? Am I growing when I reflect on and organize the work I've done? An interview is an excellent framework for this. Moreover, it allows for deeper contemplation of one's career and vocation.
