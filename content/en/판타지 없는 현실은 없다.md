title: There is no reality without fantasy
---
There is a father who exaggerates every story, making it sound like a fantasy. There is a son who disapproves of such a father. As the father is on his deathbed, the son comes to understand him. The movie ends with the son passing on exaggerated stories to his own son. We all exaggerate. We turn reality into fantasy. There is no past without editing, and no future without imagination.
