title: Balance
---

It is not strange to hold both hope and anxiety simultaneously. In fact, one should be cautious if not doing so. When faced with contradictory and ambivalent thoughts, it is important to realize that the situation is not paradoxical and to maintain balance.

1. **Similarities between Hackers and Painters**: Graham likens hackers to creative artists. Hackers solve problems and create new things through code, similar to how painters create on a canvas. Both create something that did not exist before and develop their own style and approach in the creative process.

2. **Importance of Programming Languages and Tools**: The book emphasizes that programming languages are tools for hackers. Graham argues that better tools lead to better outcomes, explaining the importance of choosing good programming languages. He specifically mentions that high-level languages like Lisp provide creative freedom to hackers.

3. **Startup Culture and Innovation**: Graham views the essence of startups as innovation and challenge. He claims that what sets startups apart from large companies is the speed and flexibility of innovation. Startups become the driving force of technological progress because they can quickly experiment with new ideas, taking on risks.

4. **Hacker Ethics and Philosophy**: Hackers value freedom and openness. Graham explains that hacker culture has developed through sharing and collaborating on technical knowledge. This is an important aspect of hacker spirit, akin to open-source software movements.

5. **Relationship between Technology and Society**: Graham explores the impact of technological advancement on society, seeing hackers as driving forces for social change. He discusses how technology can improve human life, and how hackers can lead social progress through new challenges.

6. **Philosophy of Life**: Finally, Graham emphasizes the importance of a creative life. Whether one is a hacker or an artist, it is important to love what you do and to contribute to the world through it. His philosophy accentuates the value of pursuing creativity and passion in life.

## Conclusion

- Labels such as "computer science" may cause problems for hackers. If their work is called science, there is a burden that their actions must also be scientific. Thus, hackers working in universities and research institutes may feel compelled to write research papers instead of dedicating themselves to sincerely designing beautiful software. This is because they might end up creating something mundane rather than creating something new just because it fits better with a paper topic.

- One concern is the existence of trends even in 'morality.' People assume that morality exists independently of trends, so even if morality does trend, they do not realize it. While dressing oddly may lead to ridicule, deviating from the standards of moral trends could result in dismissal, exile, imprisonment, or even execution.

- In the old era of 'conformity,' having thoughts you couldn't express might make you worry about something being wrong, wondering why you're having such thoughts. But now it's the opposite. Not having any unexpressable thoughts is definitely a sign that something is wrong.

- Early adopters, diving into trends initially, are driven by ambition. Those who think they are truly awesome wish to distinguish themselves from the ordinary crowd.

- Acknowledging the fear of seeming cowardly by keeping silent, witnessing the near-violent attacks thrown at critics by Scientology followers, or the anti-Semitic labels attached to critics of Israeli right-wing human rights abuses, and so on. Yet, the issue remains that there are too many things you cannot say. If you were to speak everything, you would lack time to accomplish what really matters. In other words, you would need to become Noam Chomsky.

- However, keeping your thoughts secret eliminates the potential for discussion. Discussion about certain thoughts leads to more thoughts. Thus, the best solution is to have friends with whom you can openly share and talk about anything.

- Those in positions to impose rules naturally want those rules followed. But consider thinking about the essence of what you truly want. You might even understand that essence.

- To create wealth, you must understand what wealth really is. Wealth is not the same as money. Wealth is fundamental—it's what we desire: food, clothing, shelter, cars, tools, and enjoyable trips, etc. You can have wealth even without money.

- Money is one means to acquire wealth and can actually be exchanged for it. However, they are not identical.

- If you own a nearly broken-down old car, instead of sitting around in the summer, you can invest time to restore it to its original state. By doing so, you are actually creating wealth.

- Hearing that 5% of the wealthy hold half of all wealth might seem unfair. For experienced programmers, it might even appear as though it's less than it should be. The top 5% of programmers write 99% of the functional software.

- Being average is problematic. In my view, the most serious issue large companies face is how to properly assess individual work performance. They often give up on accurate assessment. In large firms, you receive a fairly predictable salary if you work moderately hard. While glaring incompetence or laziness might be problematic, it doesn’t require devoting your entire life to the company’s work.

- A scale exists that represents the degree to which you dedicate your life to your work, and there is a specific economics to it. In a proper business, individuals who wholly commit themselves to their work can create ten, sometimes a hundred times more wealth than a conventional employee.

- To become wealthy, you must be in an environment where two conditions are present: fair evaluation and influence. Above all, you should be in a place where people’s abilities are assessed fairly. Without this, it’s impossible to earn more by working harder. Concurrently, influence is also necessary. You need to create situations where your decisions can exert significant impact.

- Will technology further widen the gap between the rich and poor? What is certain is that it will widen the gap between the productive and unproductive.

- There are good wastes and bad wastes in the world. I am interested in the good waste that allows simpler designs by using more resources. How can we use the cycles given to us through new, faster hardware to waste lavishly?

- Our deep-rooted desire for speed is ingrained within us due to slow, outdated computers, requiring conscious effort to overcome this desire. When designing a new language, we must consciously seek situations where we can boldly sacrifice efficiency to improve trivial conveniences.

- Mental energy in design is crucial. It's surprising how little this is emphasized. My first drawing instructor told me if something becomes boring to draw, the drawing will look boring. Imagine you need to draw a building and think to draw each brick individually. You can do so if you wish. But if you tire of drawing bricks and stop observing each brick in detail, instead rendering them mechanically, your drawing might end up poorer than if you had initially drawn them broadly.

- To produce good software, you must simultaneously hold two opposing thoughts in your mind. A naive confidence in one's abilities held by a novice hacker and skepticism held by a veteran. Thus, with one side of your brain questioning, “How hard can it really be?” and the other side thinking, “No, this will never work," you need both perspectives.

- Realizing there's no contradiction in this process is key. You are being optimistic and pessimistic about two different things. You must be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem while constantly questioning the value of the solution you have developed up to that point.

- Individuals who produce good works typically think they are creating lousy works while working. Others see the product and are amazed, but the creator only sees flaws. This pattern is not accidental. Anxiety spurs the creation of good products.

- Properly balancing hope and anxiety, they propel the project forward like two pedals powering a bicycle. As the engine of innovation with two wheels gets going, you become obsessed with tackling a problem, confident you can solve it. In the second stage, you critically assess the results of your work in the cold morning light, acknowledging its faults clearly. But as long as the critical spirit doesn't fully dampen hope, you'll honestly recognize the state of the imperfect system and still think, "How hard can it really be to fix the remaining problems?"
