When living alone, you naturally start cooking. As you cook, you often end up making pasta. I also started making something at home due to COVID, and I made pasta little by little. My interest gradually grew. I bought a stainless steel pan, burned it, and then bought Astonish detergent to clean it up again. I got a cheese grater to grate the cheese called **Parmigiano Reggiano**, which is even hard to pronounce. The kitchen was filled with various dried herbs like basil and parsley.

I bought a pasta cookbook from the bookstore. About once a quarter, I would open the book randomly and follow the recipe that appeared. From pasta with fish sauce and peanut butter that captures a Southeast Asian flavor to the unique combination of lemon and tuna pasta. On such days, I made the effort to buy new ingredients without hesitation and challenge myself in cooking. It turned into an activity of both hobby and adventure. "Taste as you go and add salt accordingly." Realizing simple principles, it felt like acquiring life's wisdom instead of memorizing recipes.

Yesterday, I received an interesting pasta recommendation from ChatGPT. It's called **Puttanesca**. Literally translated, it means “prostitute.” It made me think Italians are quite straightforward. It's said to originate from a pasta made by sex workers who had difficulty shopping for ingredients, using things like anchovies, olives, and capers that are easy to preserve. As a single-person household in Korea, I found myself in a similar situation as those Italian sex workers in terms of managing the refrigerator. Even though I often eat salmon, I never thought of buying capers—but thanks to this pasta, I purchased capers for the first time.

This kind of pasta exploration is intriguing.
