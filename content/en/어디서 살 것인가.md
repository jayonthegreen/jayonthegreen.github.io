title: Where to Live?

The book discusses the future direction of school architecture. As I read, I felt that schools seemed too prison-like. It was interesting to consider that driving a car is not solely about efficiency. A car is viewed as a private space. People pulling up their hoods create a personal space isolated from the outside—this book explores various topics from a spatial perspective.

I've recently come to appreciate the value of home and neighborhood. This book arrived at a perfect time as I was starting to pay more attention to space. I've lived in various spaces, from dormitories with living rooms, shared houses with foreigners, to semi-basements like the “500/35.” Until recently, I considered a home as just a place to sleep. However, year after year, I've found myself becoming increasingly interested in space.

The cost of living in Seoul is very high, making every decision even more important. I've always focused on transportation when choosing where to live. I've never properly asked myself the question, "Where should I live?" I need to move soon. This time, I want to think differently—consider whether there's a park nearby and what I truly want from my home.
