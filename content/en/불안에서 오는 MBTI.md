title: MBTI Stemming from Anxiety
---

The theme of Economy Chosun Issue 475 is mental healthcare. We introduce cases where various companies are addressing productivity loss by caring for their employees' mental health through EAPs (Employee Assistance Programs). International examples include [BetterUp](https://www.betterup.com/) and [Spring Health](https://springhealth.com/), while domestically there is [Mindle](https://mindle.kr/). There are also adjacent tools like meditation apps such as Calm. Looking around, there are quite a few people who struggle with anxiety. Beyond having a winning mentality, our mental health is a real issue.

The recent attention on MBTI might also stem from the emotions of anxiety. The desire to explain who we are comes from a sense of unease. Questions about one's identity and simplifying those answers can somewhat soothe our minds. This is expressed in the form of MBTI.

We increasingly tend to continue meetings only when necessary. As society reduces the frequency of meetings, concerns that were not present during frequent gatherings have increased. It has become an efficient but lonely society. This trend seems likely to continue even after the end of COVID-19. The obligatory nature of frequent meetings has disappeared. There will be a reaction in our society regarding meetings and loneliness post-COVID-19.
