title: Climate Disaster

The climate crisis is a massive trend. It's uncertain when and to what extent it will become a crisis, but it is undeniably going to be a significant problem someday. I was curious about Bill Gates' perspective on this. Bill Gates does not advocate for stopping human progress as a means of environmental protection. For instance, he doesn't argue that we should stop building.

51 billion. That's the amount of carbon emitted worldwide each year. We need to bring this number to zero. Gates examines this by breaking down the 51 billion into manufacturing, electricity production, raising/growing food, transportation, and heating/cooling.
