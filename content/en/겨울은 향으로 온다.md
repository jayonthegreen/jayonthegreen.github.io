title: Winter Comes with Scent

> “Winter comes with scent.”  

I sit at the beginning of autumn and read this sentence. I imagined the coming of winter. 

An essay deeply reveals a person's inner self. Who is Kim Gyeoul? Is she a person with a sensitive and attentive personality? How did Kim Gyeoul become a YouTuber? What makes a person captivating? Her words, "Eating meals, drinking coffee, and eventually becoming a person who lives," are comforting.
