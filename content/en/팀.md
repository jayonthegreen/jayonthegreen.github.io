A great team is not created simply by bringing together competent people.

## Summary

#### Habit 1: Build a Clock, Not a Time-Teller

The habit of successful companies is not to just 'tell time' but to 'build a clock.' This challenges the conventional wisdom that visionary companies have great ideas and charismatic leaders, moving away from seeing the company as a product medium to viewing products as tools for the company. While ideas can be abandoned or modified, a company should never be given up on. The reason visionary companies can produce great products and services is that they have established exceptional organizations.

To succeed in corporate management, one must hold a broader organizational vision and perspective of building the visionary company itself, rather than focusing solely on specific products or charismatic personal leadership.

#### Habit 2: Beyond the Profit Motive

Visionary companies do not fall prey to the 'Tyranny of the OR' which suggests that two opposing forces or ideas cannot coexist. Instead, they learn the wisdom of embracing both A and B. The most crucial step in building a visionary company is clarifying the company's core ideology.

Core ideology means 'core values + purpose.' It represents the essential and enduring beliefs of the organization and should not be confused with specific cultures or operating guidelines, nor compromised with economic interests or short-term expectations. Purpose, beyond simple profit pursuit, suggests the fundamental existential reason for the company's path without confusing it with specific objectives or management strategies. Visionary companies continuously evolve into new businesses based on such core ideology, heading towards their foundational purpose.

#### Habit 3: Preserve the Core and Stimulate Progress

By clearly defining the core, a company can more easily pursue change and development in everything outside the core.

A passion for progress enables the core ideology. Without continuous change and advancement, even a company with a strong core will ultimately fall behind in a changing world, lose vigor, and perish. The roots of such core ideology or passion for progress typically originate from specific individuals, yet visionary companies integrate and institutionalize them across all levels of the organization.

#### Habit 4: Set Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAGs)

Stimulating progress alone does not achieve a company's goals. Without absolute dedication to the goals, it is impossible. The essence of a company's goals must provide affirmative answers to questions like 'Did it stimulate progress? Did it create momentum? Did it move people? Did it invigorate employees? Are employees energized, excited, and adventurous about the goal? Are they eagerly channeling their creative talents and energies towards achieving the goal?'

#### Habit 5: Cultivate a Cult-like Culture

The term 'visionary' does not imply something soft or loose. Rather, visionary companies have a clear understanding of who they are, what they do, and what they want to achieve, and they tend not to be lenient with individuals who do not align with their demands.

#### Habit 6: Try a Lot and Keep What Works

The history of visionary companies shows that their greatest achievements did not come from detailed strategic planning but rather emerged from trying various things and stumbling upon discoveries. Successful corporate strategies result from opportunistic experiments and serendipitous findings.

The adaptability of visionary companies can be described as 'branching and pruning.' By allowing enough branches to grow on a tree while wisely selecting and cutting useless ones, one can have a tree with healthy branches adaptable to ever-changing environments.

#### Habit 7: Select Leadership from Within

Visionary companies have consistently nurtured talented managerial personnel within the company, selecting them as CEOs, which becomes a crucial means to preserve the company's core. Visionary companies tend to promote internal figures to CEO six times more often than average companies, making it a personnel principle to ensure leadership continuity that preserves the company's core rather than mere leadership excellence.

#### Habit 8: Strive for Continuous Improvement

Managers of visionary companies do not believe in making an either-or choice between short-term performance and long-term success. They prioritize long-term success while also fully committing to challenging short-term performance goals. However, having all eight habits does not automatically qualify a company as visionary. If there is a lack of 'alignment,' it is difficult to discuss a company's vision even if all eight habits are present. Alignment refers to urging all elements within the company to harmoniously function in preserving and stimulating core ideology. Ultimately, the success or failure of a company is determined by people, and maximizing voluntary commitment and creative effort from people within the company influences the company's vision.
