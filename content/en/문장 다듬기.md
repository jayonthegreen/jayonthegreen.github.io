I read about what makes writing awkward. While reading the book, I pulled out old writings and revised them, which was quite fun. My sentences were that strange.

## Summary

### Things That Show Hostility

-적, -의, 것, -들은 often habitually appear in sentences, so be careful.

- 사회**적** 현상 → 사회 현상 (social phenomenon)
- 문제**의** 해결 → 문제 해결 (problem solving)
- 사과나무**들**에 사과**들**이 열였다. → 사과나무에 사과가 열렸다. (Apples grew on the apple trees.)
- 내가 살아 있다는 **것**에 대한 증거 → 내가 살아 있다는 증거 (proof that I am alive)
- 사랑**한다는 것**은 서로를 배려**한다는 것**이다. → 사랑이란 서로를 배려하는 것이다. (Love is caring for each other.)

### Words That Are There Without Needing to Be

When adding auxiliary words, there must naturally be a reason and effectiveness for doing so. "있는, 있다" are not viruses that must be eradicated, but it's better to omit them.

- 멸치는 바싹 말라 **있는** 상태였다. → 멸치는 바싹 마른 상태였다. (The anchovies were in a completely dried state.)
- 눈으로 덮여 **있는** 마을 → 눈으로 덮인 마을 (The village covered with snow)
- 길 끝으로 작은 숲이 이어지**고 있었다**. → 길 끝으로 작은 숲이 이어졌다. (A small forest connected at the end of the road.)
- 회원들로부터 날짜를 당기라는 **요청이 있었다.** → 회원들이 날짜를 당기라고 요청했다. (Members requested to move up the date.)

### Expressions That Make You Seem Intellectually Lazy

Note that it's not an intellectual sentence, but a sentence that appears 'intellectual.' It's an expression that is wrapped to appear intellectual but actually exposes laziness.

- 그 문제**에 대해** 나도 책임이 있다. → 그 문제에 나도 책임이 있다. (I am also responsible for that problem.)
- 서로**에 대해** 깊은 신뢰를 느낀다. → 서로 깊은 신뢰를 느낀다. (They feel deep trust for each other.)
- 그녀는 전형적인 독일 여자**들 중** 한 사람이었다. → 그녀는 전형적인 독일 여자였다. (She was a typical German woman.)
- 화가는 자신의 작품**들 중** 하나에서 누군가 덧칠한 흔적을 발견하고 경악했다. → 화가는 자신의 그림 한 점에 누군가 덧칠한 흔적을 발견하고 경악했다. (The painter was shocked to find traces of overpainting in one of his paintings.)
- 시스템 고장**에 의한** 동작 오류**로 인해** 발생한 사고 → 시스템 고장에 따른 오동작 때문에 발생한 사고 (An accident caused by malfunction due to a system failure)

### Where Are My Sentences Coming From and Where Are They Going?

'-에' and '-으로' are prepositions that should not be confused.

- 이번 추석엔 고향**으로** 갈 수 없다. → 이번 추석엔 고향에 갈 수 없다. (I can't go to my hometown this Chuseok.)
- 앞**에** 가야지 뒤**에** 가면 어떡해! → 앞으로 가야지 뒤로 가면 어떡해! (You have to go forward, what if you go backward!)

'-에' and '-을' are also particles that need to be used selectively.

- 자식이 명문대**를** 가는 게 꿈인 부모들 → 자식이 명문대에 가는 게 꿈인 부모들. (Parents whose dream is for their children to go to a prestigious university.)

It's better not to use redundant expressions like '-에게로.'

- 낯선 세계로의 진입이 시작되었다 → 낯선 세계로 진입이 시작되었다 (Entry into the unfamiliar world began.)

It's also important to distinguish between using '-에' and '-에게', '-에게서.'

- 적국**에게** 선전 포고를 하다 → 적국에 선전 포고를 하다 (Declare war on the enemy nation)

The most problematic particle is '-(으)로부터.' While '-로' indicates direction, '-부터' signifies the starting point. Using '-로부터' means the direction is contradictory.

- 친구**로부터** 선물을 받았다 → 친구에게 선물을 받았다. (Received a gift from a friend.)
- 지난번의 실패**로부터** 교훈을 얻었다 → 지난번 실패에서 교훈을 얻었다. (Learned a lesson from the last failure.)
- 구멍으**로부터** 교도소 밖으로 빠져나가 도망쳤다. → 구멍을 통해 교도소 밖으로 빠져나갔다. (Escaped through a hole.)

### Sentences Covered in Passive Commands

Sentences filled with passive commands like "What can I get you to do?" Some add auxiliary verbs like '주다' after '-시키다'. For example, when saying 'Introduce a good person to me,' you might say '소개시켜 줘.' However, '시키다' is used with '주다' only when '시키다' acts as a main verb, like in '나가는 길에 짜장면 시켜 줄게' (I'll order you some jjajangmyeon on my way out) or '그래서 감독이 당신을 주인공 시켜 준다고 하던?' (So the director said they'll make you the protagonist?)

- 소개시켜 주다 → 소개해 주다. (Introduce for me)
- 주목시켜 주다. → 주목시키다 (Make pay attention)
- 연결시켜 주다 → 연결해 주다. (Connect for me)

### Whether It Can Be Done or Not

'–ㄹ 수 있다' is unnecessarily added where it's not needed.

- 1등이 **될 수 있는** 가능성이 얼마나 되는 거야? → 1등이 될 가능성이 얼마나 되는 거야? (What is the likelihood of becoming first place?)
- 우리의 목적을 이루는 데 보탬이 **될 수 있는** 능력을 갖추고자 한다. → 우리의 목적을 이루는 데 보탬이 될 능력을 갖추고자 한다. (We aim to equip ourselves with the ability to aid our goal achievement.)
- 그제야 나는 그 사실을 깨달을 **수 있었던** 것이다. → 그제야 나는 그 사실을 깨달은 것이다. (Only then did I realize that fact.)

### Sentences Are Not Fingers

Sentences are not fingers. Pronouns like '그, 이, 저, 그렇게, 이렇게, 저렇게' should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

- In his youth, father made a serious mistake. **That mistake** darkened father's life in **this way**. **This** darkness did not easily vanish, but rather affected the family negatively. **The one** most affected by **that consequence** was me. I struggled to escape **this influence**, but father's shadow ultimately dictated my life.
- → In his youth, father made a serious mistake. It was a mistake that darkened his life. The darkness did not easily vanish and negatively affected the family. I was the one most affected. Despite struggling to escape, the shadow cast over father's life ultimately dictated mine.

Expressions like 그 어느, 그 어떤, 그 누구, 그 무엇

- **그 어떤** 조치도 취하지 않았다. → 아무 조치도 취하지 않았다. (No measures were taken.)
- **그** 어떤 상황에 처하더라도 정신만 바짝 차리면 된다. → 어떤 상황에 처하더라도 정신만 바짝 차리면 된다. (No matter the situation, if you stay alert, it's fine.)

### Sentence Editing

Korean tense includes only past, present, and future, so overuse of past tense in a sentence diminishes readability and appears cluttered. Moreover, using the present tense in attributive forms, as in the corrected sentences below, seems more natural than the past tense.

- 'When I was young, we **had to** study in cramped classrooms with a stove.' → 'When I was young, we had to study in cramped classrooms with a stove.'
- **Reviewing** the materials **previously learned** is what review is about. → Reviewing learned materials is what review is about.
- During the **years wasted** in self-blame, he suffered severely from depression. → During the years spent in self-blame, he suffered severely from depression.
- The **time** spent abroad **in childhood** left me with special experiences. → The time spent abroad in childhood left me with special experiences.

The ending '–는가' is used to express questions about ongoing facts, thus it seems awkward in the following sentences. The connective ending '–는지', used to link vague questions with the facts or judgments in the following clause, is appropriate, not '–는가.'

- Observed how his situation **was unfolding.** → Observed how his situation was unfolding.
- I thought for a long time about what his passion was really trying to **show.** → I thought for a long time about what his passion was really trying to show.

From Left to Right

- Once you write "I am...", the 'I' who writes the text has already created a different 'I'. Just like children who name, dress, and build homes for their dolls, I too must provide a decent home, personality, and tasks for the subject of my writing. Only then can I write a text that unfolds completely from left to right.
- Astonishingly, only 10% of Korean high school students can solve probability problems using two dice. Among Korean high school students, only 10% can solve probability problems involving two dice. 'There are high school students who can solve probability problems using two dice (only 10%)' is an expression that can be read from left to right in this sentence.
