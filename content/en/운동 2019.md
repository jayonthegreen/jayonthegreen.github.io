2019. I lived buried under coding, English, books, and work. To create a life rhythm, I sought out exercise. By chance, I read a book called "Walking Man Ha Jung-woo" and began walking. Although at times it felt like exercising was a waste of time, as I let go and walked more often, I found it wasn’t so bad.

A colleague gifted me an Apple Watch, and my girlfriend gave me ASICS running shoes. I aimed to walk 10,000 steps a day. If I fell short, I would go out and walk, sometimes purposely choosing a distant coffee shop.

Just as walking started to feel monotonous, I began climbing with my coworkers. They taught and encouraged me, and together we would cheer "One more!" as we scaled the walls. I enjoyed the challenge of falling and climbing back. As my body improved, I was able to do 3-4 pull-ups.

On days I didn’t go climbing, I walked, ran, and did pull-ups. I had salads for one meal and reduced pizza and late-night snacks. My weight dropped from 78kg to 73kg.

Through walking, running, and climbing, I found vitality and rhythm in life. Throughout the process, the help of others was indispensable.
