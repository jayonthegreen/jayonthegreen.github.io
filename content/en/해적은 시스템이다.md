title: Pirates as a System
---
Why do pirates emerge? How do they operate? Pirates functioned much like a business. The pirate flag is branding. The pirate code serves as guidelines to harmonize interests without conflict. In an era of slavery, the pirate format was a rational system striving for equal pay for equal work. Pirates are not just reckless marauders. They only did their best to serve their interests. Pirates, with their image of madness, were actually engaged in massive profit-seeking and cooperation.
