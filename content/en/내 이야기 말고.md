title: Not My Story
---

A piece of writing that expresses thoughts and feelings without being bound by form. It's called an essay. The book contains short essays. Some are trivial, while others are sharp.

While reading, I thought I might be able to write too. So, I created a folder in my iPhone notes to write short pieces. I have mainly written about books or personal reflections. Moving forward, I want to write purely with description and feeling, different from before. I want to write pieces infused with empathy, sharpness, and thoughtfulness. I want to write not about myself, but with my perspective on external subjects.

Suddenly, I thought of some worthwhile writing topics. "Why do people buy a 2.5 million won folding bike from England," "The peculiar emotions felt from guestbook entries at lodgings," "Why don't strangers exchange casual greetings in Korea," and the like. These are light topics but are worth pondering deeply and writing about.

I'm tired of diaries now.
