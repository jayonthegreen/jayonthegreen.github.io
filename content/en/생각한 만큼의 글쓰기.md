title: Writing as Much as You Think
---

> "One must adhere to the principle of keeping the length of thought and the length of writing equal. If there aren't enough words to fully express your thoughts, the writing becomes vague, and if there are only words without thoughts, the writing tends to be dull."

I want to write well. While there are several elements to good writing, good writing comes from good thinking. In many writings, I haven't expressed my own thoughts. It often ends up being just a patchwork of content.

Writing as much as you think.
