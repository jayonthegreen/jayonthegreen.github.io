title: Reading About Iceland in Sokcho
---

I often have vague thoughts of wanting to visit mysterious natural places. The place that comes to mind is Iceland. Aurora, lava, and snow blend together to create a sense of wonder. In college, I once heard someone say, "You are like Iceland," and it made me feel good. I liked it even more because it seemed like a sophisticated compliment. They said it's because, like Iceland where lava and ice coexist, I seem to embody two extreme qualities at once. Even years later, when I think of Iceland, that comment comes to mind.

Feeling worn out from daily life, I took a solo trip to Sokcho. I stayed at a guest house attached to a bookstore. I couldn't resist buying a book. This book is about a journey in Iceland. A writer over fifty, divorced, feeling not yet successful, decides to venture on a hitchhiking journey throughout Iceland. As you read, following the timeline from before departure, boarding the plane, to arrival, it feels as if you are traveling alongside.
