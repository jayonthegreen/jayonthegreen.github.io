Sentences overloaded with adverbs and adjectives are hard to understand because they are abstract. "I wake up early in the morning" is less specific than "I wake up at 6 AM." Consider whether abstract language has been sufficiently detailed. I also complete abstract thoughts by writing in this way.

We sometimes use abstract expressions to convey feelings and information. This, too, should be boldly set aside. Write sentences filled with nouns and verbs. Hemingway expressed emotions not by explaining that a character felt a certain way, but with concise verbs like "He clenched his fists." Hemingway called this writing style his 'iceberg theory.'

One must navigate between the abstract and the concrete. This applies not just to writing but also to speaking. Details and facts are needed, rather than abstract language and feelings.
