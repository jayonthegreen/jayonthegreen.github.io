title: Illusion of Travel
---

In the summer of 2019, I impulsively set off to Europe. I went without preparation, seeking the cool vibe of traveling without a reason. However, pretending to be cool wasn't easy. Even during the trip, I searched for a reason for the journey. I couldn't endure a large expense without a purpose. Perhaps I was still too weak to travel leisurely.

It's said that travelers in Paris may experience dizziness due to the gap between fantasy and reality. I also felt a similar stress. Contrary to the fantasy of the beautiful Eiffel Tower, the reality didn't leave much of an impression. It felt like it should have been amazing, but it wasn't, and that bewildered me. Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris were mostly like that.

Returning home felt a bit empty. Seeking to understand the reason for my travel, I read this book. Kim Young-ha says, "Travel is the experience of becoming nothing in a strange place." Reading the book comforted me. The reasons for travel were closer to experiences of unfamiliar pain than to splendor.

> Some humans impose pain on themselves to confirm that such pain cannot destroy them. The relief experienced at that moment is so sweet that one must pass the test of pain to obtain that sweetness.
