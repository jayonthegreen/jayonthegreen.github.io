title: As Much As You Can Dedicate

> When office workers feel that they aren't being rewarded for their hard work, they tend to spend money extravagantly. It's not because they earn money easily, but because they feel that their worth is merely this much. - p.39

It's important not to create situations where you feel, "Do I really have to go this far just to be treated like this?"

Communicating your worth to the world is difficult. It's important not to avoid it just because it's hard. If you make a choice, you need the courage to take responsibility and refuse what you cannot uphold. Wasting energy on complaining about situations is a waste of time and energy.

Early in my career, I didn't want to seem diminished by focusing on my low salary. I found consolation in the meaning of work and personal growth beyond money. However, what I overlooked was the importance of money. Soon, I saw a discontented inner self.

Money is more important to anyone than expected. Moreover, others are less concerned about your money than you might think.
