title: From Subjective to Objective
---

I appreciate the calm demeanor of a person named Jiwung Park. I was particularly impressed by [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZGsrbQbcbE). I needed a light read from the bookstore, so I bought and read this book. Here are some memorable quotes:

- From subjective to objective: Solve problems by listing out options and eliminating the unlikely ones.
- Do not be indecisive.
- Instead of focusing on a saturated market, look at one filled with possibilities.
- Viewing the same phenomenon from different perspectives.
- Confidence and perseverance: More important than intelligence.
- Not making a decision is worse than making the wrong one.
- In terms of entrepreneurship, two people should work together not to perform better but to maintain mental stability.
