title: It's For Me
---
During the period of divided Germany, the protagonist Wiesler is a member of the East German secret police. His job is to monitor citizens to maintain ideology and order. Under the political ideology, Wiesler ignores the lives of others. However, he starts losing confidence in his work. Eventually, going against his duties, Wiesler takes a risk to protect two artists in danger. Despite his efforts, he cannot prevent their deaths.

Before their deaths, Wiesler had been monitoring the lives of these two artists. He felt a connection with them. In the last scene, when Wiesler says, “It's for me,” he reveals that his ethical reflection through the lives of others was something personal. He has changed.

I believe empathy is not merely an obligation or duty but a mutual interest. Through the ability to empathize, one can experience other lives, and there may come a day when one will be protected by the empathy of others. What happens around us could happen to anyone, including ourselves. Empathy is the natural way to live.
