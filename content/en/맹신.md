#movie 

In both science and religion, one can see people's "anger." I feel uncomfortable with the attitude of ignoring each other's thoughts and trying to change them drastically. Reflection and respect are needed. A line from the movie resonated with me: "I oppose those who blindly believe rather than the truth of humanity."

The issue of beliefs or faith can also be found in science. Science strives to maintain a rational nature but is thoroughly under the realm of beliefs and faith. Not everything proven is the whole truth. Science can be a thoroughly plausible fiction.
